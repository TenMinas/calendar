- I dated this because I am sure there will be lots of changes of direction and I wanted to record a history of our journey.
- This is a colaboration between Gary and Opio.  I want a web-based calendar app similar to Google Material 3 but developed completely in Python.

  - Front end
   - Plotly / Dash
  - Back end
   - FastApi
   - Polars
